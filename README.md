# node-openai-api-wrappers

I built these out as I explored the OpenAI API:

https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference

If you want to try them out, add your API Key to the shared.js file.

All are intended to run from terminal separately such as:
- node chat
- node code your_prompt
- node image  your_prompt
- node moderation your_input
- node text your_prompt
