# node-openai-api-wrappers

I built these out as I explored the OpenAI API:

If you want to try them out, add your API Key to the shared.js file.

All are intended to run from terminal separately such as:
- node chat
- node code <your prompt>
- node image  <your prompt>
- node moderation <your input>
- node text <your prompt>
