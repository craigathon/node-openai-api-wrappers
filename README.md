# node-openai-api-wrappers

I built these out as I explored the OpenAI API:

https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference

If you want to try them out, add your API Key to the shared.js file.
All are intended to run from terminal separatly such as:
node chat
node code
node image
node moderation
node text
